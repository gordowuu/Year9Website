    <h1>The Congo Water Crisis</h1>
    <h2>A Vicious Cycle</h2>
  </div>
</div>


<p>The Democratic Republic of Congo, also known as DRC or simply Congo is by all measures one of the poorest countries in the world. Through decades of war, political corruption and poor infrastructure continue to disrupt development in this Central African country of more than 70 million people.</p> 

<p>Mainly in rural areas, some 51 million people drink unsafe water each and every day putting them at risk of waterborne diseases ranging from diarrhea to cholera both of which can kill, the latter sometimes within hours. Furthermore, the women and children who fetch water daily, can carry only small amounts. This water, which is often contaminated goes first to drinking, then cooking leaving little or no water to practice good hygiene.</p> 

<h3>The Congo is committed to breaking this cycle and making water safe and abundant, village by village.</h3>

	<div class="flexchild"><h3>The Congo Water Crisis is steeped in poverty:</h3>
Access to basic sanitation is closely linked to the extreme poverty and suffering that persists in Congo. Many community members do not wash their hands after using the toilet or open-air defication.  This is yet another route for diseases and parasites to take hold.

	<div class="flexchild"> <h3> Dirty Water Kills </h3> The lack of access to safe drinking water and resulting poor hygiene puts people at risk of contracting deadly diseases.

The practice of open-air defecation contaminates streams and rivers. The water could be contaminated with pathogens for diseases such as diarrhea, dysentery, bilharzia, typhoid fever and cholera.
